Programming languages used in the project are - JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java and MySQL.
Framework used - React

I used Eclipse for connecting Java with MySQL servers. The authentication process (such as username & password verification), i.e. the back-end was mainly implemented using Eclipse and SQLYog.
Visual Studio Tool was used for the front-end designing. HTML, CSS and JavaScript project files were written in VS Code only.
Integration of both back-end and front-end part was done using API. API was made using Java as back-end.
